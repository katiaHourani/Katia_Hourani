Hi there, I'm Katia Hourani
# About Me
I am a graduate electrical and computer engineer from lebanese university. I am very passionate to learn about data and its evolution. I have a strong expertise in various data technologies and also gained experience in building data pipelines and optimizing data storage solutions.
# Skills and Technologies
* Python

# Projects
Here are some projects that I've worked on:
* **Plant disease Detector:** 
A robot that detect a QR code near a plant, takes photos of the plant,send it via the rasebpery pi to our model, and then detect if the plant is healthy or not using CNN model Retinanet
* **Efficient Malware Detection using CNN**:
This project is my FYP in Lebanese University- Faculty of Engineer.
  * In this project I compared 4 different models presented in research papers,in order to choose the one with lowest performance, and try to optimize it.
  * I have even discovered combinations that significantly boosted its efficacy. We have conducted these experiments on the MALIMG dataset, yielding valuable insights into controlled environments.
  * We have investigated on the MaleVIS dataset, uncovering the challenge of overfitting.
