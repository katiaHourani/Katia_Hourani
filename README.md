I am a electrical engineer student at lebanese university, curently in my fourth year.

I have accomplish many project in logic circuit, electrical machine,automatic, electrical sensors.

I'm working on a project at the meantime which will be uploaded at github when finished.
The project is a "plant disease detector" which is a robot that detect a QR code near a plant, take a specified number of photo of the plant detected,send it via the rasebpery pi to our model, so it will be able to detect the disease through a convolutional neural network(CNN) model named "RetinaNet".

The project includes an arduino code to assure the movement of the robot and the web camera fixed to it, a python code implementation for the RetinaNet model and to link the rasebpery pi to our model.

The model is trained with a dataset of almost 1000 pictures labeled as "healthy" and "nonhealthy" plant leaves. It takes an input of 20 pictures to test and get the results with accurency of 80%.

The project is still not accomplished, it will be done by 20/3/2022 and published here at my github profile.
