I am a electrical and computer engineer student at lebanese university, curently in my final year.

I have accomplish many project in logic circuit, electrical machine,automatic, electrical sensors.

I've worked on a project which will be uploaded at github a soon as possible.
The project is a "plant disease detector" which is a robot that detect a QR code near a plant, take a specified number of photo of the plant detected,send it via the rasebpery pi to our model, so it will be able to detect the disease through a convolutional neural network(CNN) model named "RetinaNet".
The project includes an arduino code to assure the movement of the robot and the web camera fixed to it, a python code implementation for the RetinaNet model and to link the rasebpery pi to our model.
The model is trained with a dataset of almost 1000 pictures labeled as "healthy" and "nonhealthy" plant leaves. It takes an input of 20 pictures to test and get the results with accurency of 80%.
